                  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">Meenar High School was established in 1972 as a joint venture between 
                    the governments of Nepal and the United Kingdom. The first batch of students 
                    took the School Leaving Certificate Examination (the national exam that is equivalent
                     to the British O level) in 1980. In 1983, English was made the official language
                      of instruction at Meenar High School. Cambridge International A level and O level, 
                      administered by CAIE of the University of Cambridge was introduced in 1985 and 1986 respectively.
                      Budhanilkantha School converted from a boys' single-sex school to a co-educational institution in 1992. 
                      Co-education at Meenar has been successful.In 1994, the British management handed over the administration
                     to Nepalese management.</p>

                  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">The school operates three courses of study:

                    School Leaving Certificate level (a nationwide curriculum up to class 10 prescribed by the Department of Education of Nepal),
                    Cambridge International A-Level
                    10+2 Level (Higher Secondary Education Board of Nepal, an equivalent alternative to A-Level).

                    Students must pass an entrance exam to gain admission into the school. Normally, entrance examinations are taken for entry into class 5 and post SLC levels. This is intended to continue the high academic status of the school.[3]
                    
                    Out of 118 students who took the School Leaving Certificate Examination 2014, 103 secured Distinction and the rest 15 students passed in the First Division.[4]

It is compulsory for students to sit exams in five subjects. Mathematics and English Language have to be studied by all students.

In A-Level exams of the year 2010, 12% of entries from the school secured grade A* and 30% entries secured grade A. 56% entries from the school secured more than or equal to grade B. 73% of the total entries, excluding General Paper, was on either math or science subjects.[6] Budhanilkantha students regularly feature in the Cambridge outstanding achiever list as the best achieving A-Level candidates in Nepal and worldwide.[7][8]</p>
